# youtube-speed-by-channel-2


## Description

This is the second iteration of a chrome extension made to control the speed of youtube videos. Used to automatically set the speed of youtube videos based on a Channel Name or Title keyword

The first iteration was written in pure HTML, CSS and JS. This was a fun and interesting endeavor but presented many challeneges that don't exist with modern state based component frameworks like React. 

Since then I have found a library called **Plasmo Framework** which should allow me to work in a more React/Typescript world rather than a traditional HTML/CSS/JS world. [Documentation here](https://docs.plasmo.com/)

I also plan on re-doing the general design to be a more intuitive system and refactoring the code to be more extensible/expandable. Also adding some new very needed features like drag and drop re-organization capabilities.
