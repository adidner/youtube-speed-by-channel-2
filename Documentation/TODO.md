[ ] not begun


<br/>



- [X] Set new Requirements
- [X] Create New Designs
- [X] Spin up basic Plasmo env
- [X] Decide on a good data model to match my system
- [ ] Look into Plasmo integration of JS libaries (See if this just works or what)
- [ ] Look into how new drag and drop re-organization could/should work
    - May be necessary to build my own instead of adopting another unfortunately
    - [ ] Oddly enough a pre-requisite to this is basically making the outline of stuff first
        - [X] Make some fake data and data model
        - [ ] Make the core components that will make things up (various list items and such)
        - [ ] Make the mapping such that my data turns into the right basic outline of components
        - [ ] Look into various options for drag and drop
        - [ ] Probably give up and build my own for my own purposes (Maybe publish into a library if I get bored)
        - [ ] Get to the point where I have the drag and drop system working exactly how I want for the purposes of actually getting my visual to change and underlying data source to also reflect the new positining (ie, can drag strings between channels and between various areas and re-order and such)
- [ ] Start build
    - [ ] Hook up everything to storage such that I can load and save to chrome storage effectively
    - [ ] Build out modals such that we can add content easily, also add buttons themselves
    - [ ] Add icons for and delete functionality in general
    - [ ] Collapsible and collape animations
    - [ ] Integrate V1 sections that allow us to manipulate the actual page video speed
        - [ ] grabbing the right screen text and comparing to our lists
        - [ ] Knowing when we've gone to a youtube channel page
        - [ ] Timer for timing out attempts to do this
        - [ ] Actually trying to change the time itself on the page
        - [ ] Adding to the page to show total time stats
- Extra nice to haves
    - Tool tips such that certain areas have popup descriptions where confusing
    - Maybe some user research or a 1 on 1 with a designer kind of thing
    - Maybe some youtube videos or descriptions of how this was done
    - Maybe use this as a plug tool for making a youtube channel that I made popular (still have to start establishing a youtube channel / personal brand first and spend some time learning the ropes and making it good, but then maybe that? Like share it with various youtube personalities etc)
